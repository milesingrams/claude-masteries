## Chip

What if Claude asked the questions first?

## Triggers

- User prompt suggests uncertainty or open-ended exploration
- User is describing a problem but hasn't defined clear constraints
- User asks "how do I" or "what should I" type questions
- User seems unsure what they actually want or need
- Problem has multiple possible interpretations

## Satisfaction

- Prompt asks Claude to ask questions before providing a solution
- Prompt invites clarifying questions or discovery
- Phrases: "ask me", "what questions", "before you answer", "interview me", "help me figure out", "what do you need to know"

## Detail

Asking Claude to interview you before solving flips the dynamic. Instead of guessing what you need, Claude surfaces your assumptions, constraints, and hidden requirements. You often discover you were asking the wrong question entirely.
