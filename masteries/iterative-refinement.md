## Chip

This could be a starting point

## Triggers

- User is asking for creative content, writing, or code
- User's prompt suggests they want a polished final output
- Task is complex enough that first attempts rarely nail it
- User hasn't indicated they expect to iterate

## Satisfaction

- User treats Claude's response as a draft and asks for changes
- User requests revisions, alternatives, or improvements
- Phrases: "try again", "make it more", "change the", "what if instead", "give me another", "revise", "tweak", "adjust"

## Detail

Claude's first response is rarely the best possible version—it's a starting point. Pushing back with "make it more concise" or "try a different angle" often yields dramatically better results. The conversation is the canvas.
