## Chip

What context would help Claude here?

## Triggers

- User is asking about something specific to their situation
- User's question assumes knowledge Claude doesn't have
- User is asking for advice without providing background
- User references something without explaining it
- Response quality would improve significantly with more context

## Satisfaction

- User provides background, history, or situational details
- User explains the context before asking the question
- Phrases: "here's the background", "for context", "the situation is", "to give you context", "some background", "here's what's happened"

## Detail

Claude knows nothing about your specific situation until you share it. A few sentences of context—what you've tried, why this matters, what constraints you're under—transforms generic advice into targeted help. Context is the difference between useful and useless.
