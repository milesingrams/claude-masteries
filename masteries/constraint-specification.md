## Chip

What constraints matter here?

## Triggers

- User is asking for creative or open-ended output
- User hasn't specified format, length, tone, or audience
- Request could reasonably go in many different directions
- User is asking for writing, code, or other generative content
- Output quality would benefit from clearer boundaries

## Satisfaction

- User specifies format, length, tone, style, or audience
- User defines what to include or exclude
- User sets boundaries on the response
- Phrases: "keep it", "no more than", "in the style of", "for [audience]", "avoid", "don't include", "format as"

## Detail

Constraints aren't limitations—they're creative fuel. Telling Claude the format, length, tone, audience, or what to avoid focuses the response dramatically. The more specific your boundaries, the less Claude has to guess.
