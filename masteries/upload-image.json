  "description": "Shares images directly with Claude for visual analysis rather than describing them in words. Surface when user describes something visual, asks about an image, screenshot, or diagram, or tries to explain something that would be easier to show. Satisfied when user uploads visual content using phrases like: here's an image, look at this, see this screenshot, I've attached a photo, here's what I'm seeing, let me show you.",
  "detail": "A picture is worth a thousand words—and Claude can see them. Screenshots, diagrams, photos, charts—upload them directly and ask Claude to interpret, analyze, or respond. Describing visual content takes effort and loses detail; sharing it is instant and complete."
