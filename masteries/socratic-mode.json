  "detail": "Asking Claude to interview you before solving flips the dynamic. Instead of guessing what you need, Claude surfaces your assumptions, constraints, and hidden requirements. You often discover you were asking the wrong question entirely.",
  "surface_triggers": "User describes a problem without clear constraints. User asks 'how do I' or 'what should I' questions. User seems uncertain what they need. Problem has multiple possible interpretations."
