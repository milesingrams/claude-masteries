## Chip

Claude could look at this directly

## Triggers

- User is describing something visual
- User is asking about an image, screenshot, or diagram
- User is trying to explain something that would be easier to show
- User references visual content without sharing it
- Task involves analyzing, interpreting, or responding to something visual

## Satisfaction

- User uploads or attaches an image
- User shares a screenshot, photo, or visual directly
- Phrases: "here's an image", "look at this", "see this screenshot", "I've attached a photo", "here's what I'm seeing"

## Detail

A picture is worth a thousand words—and Claude can see them. Screenshots, diagrams, photos, charts—upload them directly and ask Claude to interpret, analyze, or respond. Describing visual content takes effort and loses detail; sharing it is instant and complete.
