  "detail": "Claude can evaluate its own work with surprising honesty. Asking 'what might be wrong with this?' or 'what did you miss?' often surfaces blind spots, assumptions, or alternatives that weren't in the first response. It's like getting a second opinion for free.",
  "surface_triggers": "User has received a response and is continuing the conversation. User seems uncertain about the quality of Claude's output. Task involves analysis, writing, or recommendations where blind spots matter. Response would benefit from a second pass."
