## Chip

Claude could search the web for this

## Triggers

- User is asking about current events or recent information
- User wants information that might have changed recently
- User is asking about something Claude might not have trained on
- Question involves real-time data like prices, news, or status
- User is fact-checking or needs up-to-date sources

## Satisfaction

- User asks Claude to search or look something up
- User requests current or recent information explicitly
- Phrases: "search for", "look up", "find recent", "what's the latest", "current", "up to date", "can you search"

## Detail

Claude's knowledge has a cutoff date, but it can search the web for current information. For recent news, live data, or anything that changes over time, asking Claude to search gets you fresher, more accurate results than relying on training data alone.
