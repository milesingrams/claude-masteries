## Chip

You could think through this with Claude, not just get an answer

## Triggers

- User is making a decision or weighing options
- User is exploring an idea that isn't fully formed
- User is asking for advice on something complex
- Problem seems to benefit from dialogue rather than a single answer
- User is brainstorming or in early stages of a project

## Satisfaction

- User asks Claude to explore, brainstorm, or think together
- User invites back-and-forth rather than requesting a final answer
- Phrases: "help me think through", "brainstorm with me", "let's explore", "what are the angles", "think with me", "talk this through"

## Detail

Claude doesn't have to be an answer machine. You can use it as a thinking partner—someone to explore ideas with, surface considerations you missed, and help you reason through complexity. The goal isn't always an answer; sometimes it's clarity.
