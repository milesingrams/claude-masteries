  "description": "Provides background information before asking a question so Claude can give targeted rather than generic responses. Surface when user asks about something specific to their situation without providing background, references something without explaining it, or asks for advice without context. Satisfied when user provides situational details using phrases like: here's the background, for context, the situation is, to give you context, some background, here's what's happened, I've already tried.",
  "detail": "Claude knows nothing about your specific situation until you share it. A few sentences of context—what you've tried, why this matters, what constraints you're under—transforms generic advice into targeted help. Context is the difference between useful and useless."
