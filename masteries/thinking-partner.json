  "detail": "Claude doesn't have to be an answer machine. You can use it as a thinking partner—someone to explore ideas with, surface considerations you missed, and help you reason through complexity. The goal isn't always an answer; sometimes it's clarity.",
  "surface_triggers": "User is making a decision or weighing options. User is exploring an idea that isn't fully formed. User is asking for advice on something complex. Problem benefits from dialogue rather than a single answer. User is brainstorming or in early project stages."
