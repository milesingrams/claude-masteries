  "chip": "You could think through this with Claude, not just get an answer",
  "description": "Uses Claude as a collaborative thinking partner for exploration and reasoning rather than just an answer machine. Surface when user is making a decision, weighing options, exploring an unformed idea, or brainstorming in early project stages. Satisfied when user invites exploration or dialogue using phrases like: help me think through, brainstorm with me, let's explore, what are the angles, think with me, talk this through.",
  "detail": "Claude doesn't have to be an answer machine. You can use it as a thinking partner—someone to explore ideas with, surface considerations you missed, and help you reason through complexity. The goal isn't always an answer; sometimes it's clarity."
