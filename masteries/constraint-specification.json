  "description": "Shapes better outputs by specifying boundaries like format, length, tone, audience, or exclusions. Surface when user asks for creative or open-ended output without specifying format, length, tone, or audience, or when the request could reasonably go many directions. Satisfied when user defines boundaries using phrases like: keep it, no more than, in the style of, for [audience], avoid, don't include, format as, make it [adjective].",
  "detail": "Constraints aren't limitations—they're creative fuel. Telling Claude the format, length, tone, audience, or what to avoid focuses the response dramatically. The more specific your boundaries, the less Claude has to guess."
