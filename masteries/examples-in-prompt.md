## Chip

You could show Claude what good looks like

## Triggers

- User is asking for content in a specific style or format
- User wants output that matches something they've seen before
- User is asking for something where "you'll know it when you see it"
- Task involves creative work with subjective quality
- User seems to have a specific vision but hasn't articulated it

## Satisfaction

- User includes an example of what they want in their prompt
- User shows Claude a reference to match or emulate
- Phrases: "like this example", "here's what I mean", "something similar to", "in this style", "match this format", "for example"

## Detail

Describing what you want is hard. Showing it is easy. Including an example—a sentence in the right tone, a snippet in the right format, a reference to match—gives Claude a target to aim for. One good example is worth a hundred words of description.
